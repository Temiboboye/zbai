Quick math for you:

If you manage 5 clients with 50K contacts each:
- Traditional tools: 5-8% bounce rate = 12,500-20,000 wasted emails
- ZeroBounce AI: 1-2% bounce rate = 2,500-5,000 wasted emails

**That's 10,000-15,000 more emails delivered per campaign.**

At $0.01/email, that's $100-150 saved per campaign.
Over 12 campaigns/year = $1,200-1,800 saved per client.
Across 5 clients = $6,000-9,000/year.

Plus, better deliverability = better campaign results = happier clients = higher retention.
