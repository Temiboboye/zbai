Subject: Helping {{company}} prove ROI to clients

Hi {{first_name}},

Running an agency is tough - you're only as good as your last campaign.

I noticed {{company}} specializes in {{service}} for {{industry}} clients.

Quick question: how often do client email campaigns underperform because of bad data quality?

We built ZeroBounce AI specifically for agencies managing multiple client lists:

- 98%+ accuracy (better results for clients)
- Confidence scoring (data-driven decisions)
- White-label option (your branding)
- Volume discounts (better margins)
