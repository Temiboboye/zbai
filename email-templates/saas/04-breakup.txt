Subject: Should I close your file?

{{first_name}},

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing:

a) Email deliverability isn't a priority right now
b) You're already happy with your current solution
c) My timing is just off

If it's (a) or (b), no worries - I'll close your file.

If it's (c), just reply "later" and I'll check back in Q3.

Either way, here's your 49 free credits if you want to test us out: {{signup_link}}

Best,
