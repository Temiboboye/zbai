Subject: Quick question about {{company}}'s email deliverability

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company}} recently {{trigger_event}} - congrats!

Quick question: are you seeing bounce rates above 3-5% on your email campaigns?

Most SaaS companies we work with lose 5-8% of their emails to bounces, which damages sender reputation and costs real revenue.

We built ZeroBounce AI to solve this - our AI-powered verification hits 98%+ accuracy (vs. 92-95% for traditional tools) and includes confidence scoring for catch-all domains.
