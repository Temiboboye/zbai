Subject: Re: Quick question about {{company}}'s email deliverability

Hi {{first_name}},

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this quick.

I put together a quick analysis of common email deliverability issues for SaaS companies at {{company}}'s stage:

1. **Catch-all domains** - Traditional tools can't verify these (30% of B2B emails). We use AI to give you a 0-100 confidence score.

2. **Pattern recognition** - Our AI suggests correct email formats when you have partial info (saves hours of manual research).

3. **Domain reputation** - We flag risky domains before they damage your sender score.

Companies like {{competitor}} saw 60% fewer bounces after switching to us.

Best,
