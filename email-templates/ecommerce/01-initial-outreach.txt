Subject: {{company}}'s cart abandonment emails - quick question

Hi {{first_name}},

I was checking out {{company}}'s site (love the {{product}}!) and had a quick question:

What % of your cart abandonment emails are bouncing?

Most e-commerce brands we work with lose 5-8% of these high-value emails to bounces - that's direct revenue lost.

We built ZeroBounce AI to fix this:
- 98%+ accuracy (more emails delivered)
- Real-time API (verify at checkout)
- Catch-all scoring (know which emails to trust)

A 3% improvement in deliverability could mean thousands in recovered revenue.

P.S. Most e-commerce brands see ROI in the first week.
